# 6 - Forms

It is often joked that frontend developers spend most of their time just editing buttons on forms. 

Theoretically though, if this turned out to be true, wouldn't it behoove you to ensure you knew your way around forms?

# Key Term

# <form> </>
  An HTML tag for a section of interactive inputs, used for
  submitting information to the server. Forms usually contain
  a variety of label-input pairs and a submit button.

  For example, this is a valid HTML form:

<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" />

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" />

  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
