# 2 - Semantic HTML

If a human being were to read your markup code without any accompanying visual representation, would they still have a clear understanding of the general structure of your page?

# Key Term

# [Semantic_HTML]

  HTML that clearly describes the content of the page. HTML loses its semantic meaning
  when tags are misused, or generic tags (namely <div> and <span>) are overused instead of semantic tags.


  Semantic HTML includes the usage of `semantic grouping tags`, which
  give meaning to different sections of the page. These are some of the
  most commonly used semantic grouping tags:

  • <article>: Self contained, independently distributable content.

  • <section>: Thematic grouping of content, not self contained.

  • <header>: Introductory content.

  • <main>: Main content, limited to one per page.

  • <nav>: A section of links, oftentimes for the primary navigation of the page.

  • <aside>: Non-vital content indirectly related to main content. The page would make sense without this content.

  • <footer>: Footer of the document, oftentimes containing copyright information.
